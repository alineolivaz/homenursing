# homenursing

Homenursing is a website made with php and javascript for finding and applying to nursing and healthcare jobs.

## Installation

Use the Xampp or WampServer + SQL web administrators like phpMyAdmin to execute the project. It will allow the web application to run with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database.

Launch it normally with the Xampp/WampServer. I use ```localhost/homenursing```.
